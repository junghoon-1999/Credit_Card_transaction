However, for this model the `TransactionDT` column was dropped as this has proved to create a better fit for this model. This was not surprising as the rows of the column are almost all unique from each other. Moreover, although HistGradientBoostingClassifer is capable of handling NA entries in the dataset, we imputed the null values with -1 as this improved the score of the model."
